# Hypergolic Propellants

>[!Definition]
>A **hypergolic** propellant doesn't require ignition. It will auto-combust upon mixing with another substance

The most common hypergolic combination is *hydrazine* and *dinitrogen tetroxide*. In fact, if you come across the term "hypergol" or even just "hypergolic propellant", you can assume it's a combination of these two

| **Simpler engine required**. Hypergolic propellants don't require ignition to combust due to their self-combustive properties, hence the rocket engines can be less complex | **Handling the chemicals will be difficult** due to their oft-corrosive and volatile nature. Care should also be taken to not have the two chemicals come into contact accidentally to avoid a disastrous blast |
