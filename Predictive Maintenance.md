>[!Definition]
>Predictive Maintenance is a form of condition-based monitoring where the state of in-service equipment and devices is monitored to estimate when maintenance should be performed

## Benefits 
- Promises cost savings because maintenance is only performed when necessary and not in fixed intervals regardless of the health of the system
- By potentially targeting and performing maintenance before something goes wrong, the overall lifespan of the system is improved and performance is not hindered
- Predictive maintenance increases overall safety as well, because the issues are addressed before it's too late. 

The prime philosophy of predictive maintenance is
> The right information at the right time

Predictive maintenance is performed using data collection and analysis, early fault detection, maintenance scheduling, and resource optimization, to name a few. They can be achieved using several technologies 
[[Internet of Things (IoT)]] clusters are employed to collect system and equipment data about its health and performance. The big data collected can then be processed using AI and ML algorithms and advanced analytics to predict potential system crutches and resolve them on time
