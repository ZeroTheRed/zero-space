North Korea has recently been testing missiles. They attempted a failed launch of their Chollima-1 rocket on May 27 but they're doing something unexpected now
- More-than-expected rocket tests at the Sohae launch centre
- A Russian delegation is present too. This hints to a possible defence collaboration between North Korea and Russia 
- They announced that they are using kerosene and liquid oxygen as rocket fuel. Earlier, they used a combination of hydrazine and dinitrogen tetroxide, which are [[Hypergolic Propellants]]
