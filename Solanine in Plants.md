# Solanine in Plants
## Motivation
I want to keep myself informed on how to pick the best fruits and vegetables that are safe to consume 

Solanine is a glycoalkaloid poison that belongs to the saponin family. Solanine is commonly found in the nightshade family of plants such as potatoes, tomatoes, and eggplant

>[!Warning]
>If you see green patches on potatoes, tomatoes, or any other plant of the nightshade family, do not consume that part for that is due to the concentration of solanine, which can cause issues to your body
