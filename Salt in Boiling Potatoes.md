# Salt in Boiling Potatoes
### Motivation
To record all that I'm learning about good cooking skills

### Notes
Salt is added when you're boiling potatoes in order to draw out the flavour of the potatoes
When boiling pasta, we add salt to the water to help amplify the flavour of the pasta that salt delivers without adding extra sodium to the food. Pasta is starchy, and so are potatoes. Hence, we add salt to boiling potatoes for the same reason
