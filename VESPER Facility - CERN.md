I was reading about the new VESPER facility at CERN as I was curious about ESA's [[JUICE - ESA|JUICE]] mission that sent a probe to study the [[Jovian]] ocean-holding moons (Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa). All components of the probe must be tested for endurance against high levels of radiation and electron flux, which is present in the zone of the Jovian moons
