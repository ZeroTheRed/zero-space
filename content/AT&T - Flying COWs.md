**COW** - **C**ell **O**n **W**ings
Drones to **provide network connectivity** in remote and/or disaster-hit zones. The drone is a **cell site** or an [[Aerial Base Stations (AeBS)|Aerial Base Station (AeBS)]]

Beams **LTE** coverage and more recently, **5G**

#### How does it work?
The drone carries a **small cell** and **antenna**. It is **tethered to the ground to provide continuous power** and **provides secure fiber data connection** -- unlimited flight time

Data -> Drone -> Tether -> Dish -> Cloud Network

The COW uses **satellite** to transmit text, calls, and data.
It can stay on air for up to **24 hours** or even up to **16 days** *provided it meets the daily safety checks*
#### Benefits?
1. **Ad hoc** - The COWs can be *deployed anytime and anywhere*, even in remote areas. The *small size* of the drone improves its ease of deployment
2. **Internet from the Heavens** - Flying COWs can hit altitudes of over *300 ft* to provide vast coverage. This is *~500% higher than a traditional COW mast*. This enables coverage up to *103.6 sq. km*
3. **The More, The Merrier** - Drones are highly *scalable* and more flying COWs can be deployed readily to *expand coverage*
4. **Stoicism** - Flying COWs are tough and can resist adverse weather conditions
