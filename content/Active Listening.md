Active listening is all about thoroughly participating in a conversation and listening to what others are saying to full effect. This is becoming quite relevant given our [[Our attention span is lowering|decreasing attention span]]
### 5 Elements of Active Listening
1. **Paying attention** - Pay close attention to what the person is speaking without interrupting them. Observe their body language carefully for hints and further contextual information. Try not to distract yourself
2. **Showing your listening** - Provide acknowledgement to the speaker that you are listening to them all the way through by means of vocal or body language gestures
3. **Providing Feedback** - Tell the speaker your interpretation of what they said without judgment. Ask questions to either gather more information or to consolidate what you have heard already
4. **Deferring Judgment** - Don't prematurely form judgments, rebuttals, or counterpoints without letting them finish and without understanding everything first. Let any thought that pops up during listening brew
5. **Responding** - Respond politely and constructively

### Tips
* **If you're having trouble concentrating,** mentally repeat the person's word over to reinforce their message in your mind and help my focus
* **Maintain eye contact**. This is a strong indication that you're listening and it gives you a boost in self-confidence. It also gives the person a clear-shot signal that you're not someone they can take for granted
