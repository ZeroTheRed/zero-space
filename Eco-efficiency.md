# Eco-efficiency
>[!Motivation]-
>* Preserving and improving the environment while also keeping industries operational. Protecting Earth and meeting our needs can co-exist. How can we ensure that?
>
>* To improve planetary health by understanding and improving the value chain
### Notes
Wikipedia defines **eco-efficiency** as follows:

> The delivery of goods and services to meet human needs and improve quality of life while progressively reducing their environmental impacts of goods and resource intensity during their life-cycle at least to the level of Earth's estimated *carrying capacity*

The jargon may be quite corporate-y but the idea is quite simple - *to keep our industries going while protecting nature*. Presently, the very thought of industries and manufacturing plants conflicts with the idea of keeping mother nature clean and unaffected. There's always environmental degradation along with industrial operations. Eco-efficiency aims to change that

Eco-efficiency is an important part of [[Sustainability]], and is an integral aspect that we all have to keep in mind in order to maintain the *triple bottom line* - The 3 'P's of **People**, **Planet**, and **Profit**
### Examples
**Ecotourism** is a good example of where the concepts of eco-efficiency are applied in full swing. "Responsible travel", so to speak. In fact, eco-efficiency principles can be applied anywhere because I think *all industries have some connect or the other to nature*. Food industries eject plenty of waste and can leave a marked impact on agriculture, which itself impacts nature. Automation using robots requires significant consumption of raw materials, which are sourced neither ethically or ecologically

AI itself is a field that can fire an ugly punch into nature's gut. The training of LLMs requires significant computational power and that draws a lot of electricity and raw materials. We can see where that's going...
