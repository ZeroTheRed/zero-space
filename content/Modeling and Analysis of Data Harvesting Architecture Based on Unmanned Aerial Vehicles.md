>[!Summary]
>*Wireless [[Internet of Things (IoT)|IoT]] architecture* based on [[Unmanned Aerial Vehicle - Basics|UAVs]]
>
>A *fleet* of UAVs is deployed and is *locked to motion* at a *fixed altitude*. *IoT devices on ground* can uplink to the UAV fleet *upon the latter's motion* and *presence above them* -> Network performance depends on *geometric* and *dynamic* characteristics of the system

### Evaluation metrics
- **Interference**
- **Coverage Probability**
- **Data rate of a UAV**

**Trade-off**: *Harvesting capability* <--> *IoT scheduling window*

#### Drivers for Adoption - Why is a mobile UAV fleet important?
Currently, IoT systems transmit data to the internet using *fixed network infrastructures* such as base stations
IoT data *-->* Narrowband-IoT, LoRaWAN *-->* Fixed Network Infra

IoT systems can vary in size (they are *scalable*). The *greater the size*, the *more dense and numbered* the *network infra* required.
