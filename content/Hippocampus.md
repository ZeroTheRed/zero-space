Latin for sea horse

It controls **memory formation** - It decides **which memories to form**

The **hippocampus** stores **explicit memories**, which are of two types:
- **Episodic memories** - Memories of ==events==
- **Semantic memories** - Memories of ==facts==

Both memories are **initially** stored as **short-term memories**. Over time, some of them become **long-term** memories that are stored in the **neocortex**

##### What decides what memories become long-term? 
When we learn something at **first**, it becomes an **episodic** memory - You don't remember *what you learned* but *when you learned it*

Over time, it translates into a **semantic** memory - You now remember *what you learned* rather than *when you learned it*

- **Repetition** - The same neural pathways are being ==repeatedly activated==

**Spaced repetition** is powerful. This is where we **repeatedly activate** the same neural pathways in intervals. That's how we form more **long-term semantic memories**

>[!info]
>Much of the short-to-long term memory encoding and memory formation happens dominantly during **sleep**

* **Reward** or **Motivation** - The reason for learning what we're learning
The **prefrontal cortex** and **amygdala** form the [[Reward System]] in your brain
