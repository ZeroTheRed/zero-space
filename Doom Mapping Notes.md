This folder is where I will be streaming my thoughts and learnings while mapping Doom levels. This is, for now, solely meant to be a personal journal and will seek to be an outlet for me to externalize my thought process as I mess around with Doom. It also serves to record all of my Doom mapping engagements for historical purposes -- My future self would love to see what I have been doing
