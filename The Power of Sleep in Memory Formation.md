Sleep helps consolidate memories and encode short-term memories into the prefrontal cortex, where they become long-term. The brain is active during sleep, where it algorithmically goes through important events recorded during the previous day and it processes them into long-term memory

REM sleep enhances procedural memory consolidation
Deep sleep enhances declarative memory consolidation
