## Hello there! 

I am Tushar, and you are entering my [[Digital Garden]] and personal wiki

This site takes up multiple forms
- **Braindump/Wiki** - Anything interesting and cool that I'm learning will be recorded here
- **Blog** - You will find my thoughts and musings, which I post sporadically
- **Archive** - Awesome YouTube videos, websites, second brains, books, and songs will be found here. If you're looking for recommendations and want a peek into my personal tastes, you'll find the archive fun

>[!Note]
>My digital garden is quite unpolished and haphazard. If you see half-complete, cryptic, and scattershot arrangements of my notes, that's because it's a work-in-progress. Also, this is more of my attempt of **learning in public**
>

With that said, enjoy my garden!
