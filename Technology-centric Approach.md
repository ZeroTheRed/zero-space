# Motivation
I wanted to explore the technique of problem-solving and innovation that my uncle suggested when I was working on the task for my upcoming interview at Deloitte
I also intend to learn how to start from ground zero and appreciate the functionality of technology to see everything that is possible with it and everything that isn't

>[!Definition]
>**Technology-driven Innovation** or **Technology-push Innovation** is the method of innovation in problem solving that follows a bottom-up approach where you start with the technology and branch out to its potential applications and use cases

The core idea with pursuing Technology-Driven Innovation (TDI) is to **exploit and research emergent and disruptive technologies to develop potential use cases and applications**. With this, we can drive added value and address customer needs using technology

## Why is this a good approach?
****
- Sometimes, a **lot of potential possibilities and use cases can show up** when I study what something is capable of. When I'm examining a [[Problem-centric Approach|market or customer problem]], I am focusing on only one domain. The challenge imposes quite a few constraints that limits my free thinking. In TDI, however, I can think freely and develop a wide variety of use cases and hence, **solve multiple problems with one technology** rather than solve one problem with multiple technologies
- I find that this method also **justifies the importance of the technology** that is being researched. TDI enforces a thorough analysis and examination of technology, and that invigorates our understanding of it
- Considering that I am a technical-minded person given my educational background and experience insofar, TDI fits my predisposition of thinking well. **TDI emphasizes the importance of the technological mind in solving problems**. and more use cases and solutions are easily developed when we understand something from an *engineer's perspective*
- One of my core personal strengths is interdisciplinary and associative thinking. This is where I connect seemingly unrelated concepts together to forge new insights and knowledge. TDI encourages interdisciplinary thinking by exploring **how technology under focus fits in a plethora of various scenarios**


## Steps for TDI
****
### Identify a technology and list all of its capabilities

**Pick a technology**. This can be hard because there are so many technologies out there. To navigate through this hurdle, I came up with some criteria to zero in on the right technology to select
- The technology should be **highly versatile and adaptable**
- The technology should have **disruptive and breakthrough potential** 
- The technology should be **future-ready** (it may be so that right now, it is a hard sell due to its nascence but if it is poised to be highly valuable in the future, then I will pick it)
Once selected, it's time to develop a mind-map and list out all capabilities of the technology. What can it do? What is it capable of?

### Link these capabilities to various problems and challenges

**Each capability can make the corresponding technology perfect for a specific real-world problem**. Come up with, or attach an existing use case to each capability. Sometimes, there may be use cases that require multiple functions of the technology. Include them too, *the graph need not necessarily be linear*
