# Technology Demonstrators

Airbus Vahana & CityAirbus. Both are eVTOL vehicles

## Vahana
- Tandem Tilt-wing aircraft
- Single passenger
- Weight: 750 kg
- Self-piloted operations
- 8 x 45 kW propellers
- Demonstrated Range: 50 km
- Longest flight time: 20 min
- Battery Capacity: 38 kWh
- 138 test flights completed
A wing configuration was important because this would be efficient during cruise mode
Tilted wing are complex and there may be difficulties in scaling the technology

## CityAirbus
- Helicopter (hover) configuration
- Lift weight of 2-3 T (4-5 passengers)
- Remotely operated
- 8 x 100 kW propellers

## CityAirbus NextGen
- Sound levels: 65-70 dbA (Noise level as observed)
- Demonstrated Range (Operating): 80 km
- Cruise Speed: 120 km/h
- 8 propellers (complex but not overly complicated - redundancy measures)
	- 6 lifters
	- 2 inclined pushers
	- Two fins and horizontal stabilizer (Pi wing)
	- Control is achieved by changing the rotor speeds
	- No control surface (a conscious decision implemented for simplicity and focus towards learnings from the demonstrators)
- Remotely piloted for now, will remove pilot later
- V-shaped tail wing
- Simulation and Testing
	- CFD
	- Wind tunnel
	- Subscale

EASA Special Condition requirements for eVTOLs (EU) in effect from July 2019 - Even if something goes wrong during a potentially catastrophic event, safe flight and landing is required
In conventional helicopter and airplanes, a potential catastrophic event can lead to the loss of the aircraft but the probability of that happening should be reduced to 10^-9

## Follow Up
- How does the tilt-wing configuration work and why is it difficult to scale?
- Does the arrangement of propellers affect the noise produced by the eVTOL?
- What is the average and maximum altitude attained by eVTOLs?
