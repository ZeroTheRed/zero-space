**Power Beaming** - Collecting solar energy in space and beaming the power down to Earth using microwave or laser technology 
### Advantages 
1. **Pure Solar Power** - Collecting solar energy in space yields more power because of no atmospheric interference and round-the-clock solar availability
2. **Economies of Scale** - While the initial investment of SBSP would be high, the costs will be dramatically reduced in the long run as more power Beaming factories emerge. Also, once constructed, remains constructed 
3. **Remote Power on Air** - SBSP farms can also beam power to UAVs, other satellites, and aircraft as needed
### Challenges
1. **Costly Start** - Initial investments are quite high. Also, SBSP isn't fully justified when extremely cheap ground-based renewables exist such as wind etc.
2. **Satellite Sabotage** - Space Farms can be hacked to beam malicious information instead of power. Moreover, if a lot of power rests on a single farm, then destroying that farm would cut off immense power to huge regions
