Data processing and analytics are moved to the **cloud** network. Rather than using local compute to process the data, all of it is transmitted to a remote network of machines where the data is processed as required 

### Where would this work?
* Delay-tolerant systems
* Little to no real-time requirements 
* High computational capacity required (which local systems don't have)
* Globally accessible data storage
