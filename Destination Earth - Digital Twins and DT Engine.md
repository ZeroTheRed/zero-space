>[!Summary]
>The two Digital Twins (DTs) of ECMWF's Destination Earth are **Climate Change Adaptation Digital Twin (Climate Adaptation DT)** and **Weather-induced Extremes Digital Twin (Extremes DT)**
>
>The Digital Twin Engine is the software infrastructure that enables implementation and eventual operation

These DTs provide high-resolution and high-accuracy simulations of Earth's climate. It integrates *Earth systems* with *sectors most affected by climate change* and extreme weather

## Extremes DT
The *continuous component* of the Extremes DT will provide **global kilometre-scale simulation** capabilities to **predict weather extremes** in a span of a few days

The *on-demand component* of the Extremes DT provides **configurations for an interactive European monitoring and prediction framework**. This framework functions at a **sub-km scale** for meteorological, hydrological, and air quality extremes

## Climate Adaptation DT
The Climate Adaptation DT will provide **global kilometre-scale simulation** for **local to global and national climate scenarios**. The simulations will cover weather information spanning **multiple decades**. **Uncertainties** are also accounted for

## DT Engine
The Digital Twin Engine is the software infrastructure for powering the two DTs using **extreme-scale computing** for the simulations, **data handling**, **data fusion**, and **ML**
*EuroHPC supercomputers* will be leveraged to run the DTs and allow for their on-demand trials for application-specific scenarios
