This note is to curate fleeting ideas about drones that come to mind. I plan to research the idea more to see if it already implemented and if not, explore the implications of it and attempt to develop solutions. A lot of my ideas come either by pure associative thinking or by coming across something related in news articles

## Residential Drones
What about giant mega-drones in which people can live? UAVs that can function as houses, office spaces, or public gathering spots would be a cool idea to explore. What about making drones function as portable real estate?

This would be functionally advantageous in many ways. One such benefit would be seen during moments of natural or wartime disasters where homes can be conveniently moved to a safe spot rather than evacuation and migration. The house itself can be saved from getting ravaged by the effects of war/disasters because it can be moved in 3D space freely

However, I think this is impractical for now due to several real-world limitations
- If I move a house and place it somewhere, how will I connect that house to the power grid, water and gas pipelines? If that isn't possible, the residential drone should have a large power battery as well as portable water and gas reservoirs. The size of the reservoirs would either be humongous or frequent refilling and recharging would be required
- The drone should possess immense propulsion and lift power to transport an entire building with people in it, and no drone to my limited knowledge can move weights as heavy as those of buildings

## Shock-absorbing Drones
Drones that can absorb physical and kinetic impact and still survive with little to no damage at all. Modular drones might be able to pull this off but it might be necessary in the future to have drones with basic suspension and shock-absorbing capabilities. Drones are quite fragile

## Environmentally Sustainable and Recyclable Drones
Drones that are built entirely using eco-friendly materials. Upon decommissioning, the drone can even be repurposed or recycled into a different drone or machine instead of condemning the drone to the junkyard and replacing it with a whole other drone
I got this idea when reading an article about the rising preference of sustainable lighting choices in interior design and thought I could bring that concept over to UAVs, if it doesn't exist already
