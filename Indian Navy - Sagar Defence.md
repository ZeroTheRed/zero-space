# Indian Navy - Sagar Defence

**Date**: 2023
**Participants**:
* Sagar Defence Engineering
* Indian Navy

The Indian Navy successfully completed a test of a **quadcopter** built by Sagar Defence, taking off from **INS Vikrant**, the Navy's aircraft carrier. It also **landed** on another ship[^1]. The drones will be important to the **Naval Shipborne Aerial System (NSAS)**

In the 2000s, the Navy inducted the **Searcher** and **Heron** drones from Israel, which helped with **ISTAR** and **COMINT (Communications Intelligence)** missions using **electro-optic cameras**
#### What is the Indian Navy working on?
1. **Landing Platform Decks (LPD)** - LPDs are *amphibious warfare ships* that support the *take-off, transport, and landing* of landing craft for expeditionary war missions[^2]. LPDs can be useful for *landing and moving UAVs* for ISTAR missions too
2. **Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAV)** - UCAVs are drones specialized for combat and warfare missions
3. **Transfer UAV Command** - When a drone is launched from one warship, the Navy can *transfer its command and control* to another designated warship securely[^3]

#### Advantages
1. **God's Eye** - UAVs are great for *persistent surveillance* and *real-time monitoring* of any spot. This helps boost *situational awareness*
2. **Catch the Signals** - UAVs can intercept and analyse *enemy signals* and provide valuable insights into enemy plans and movement to give the Indian Navy a *tactical advantage*
3. **Lock-on** - Drones can perform *Automatic Target Recognition (ATR)* to lock on to targets with high accuracy and precision
4. **Send and Forget** - Drones can be programmed to *autonomously track targets* and *follow waypoints*
5. **Extended Ears** - UAVs help in bridging communications between the Navy warships and Navy satellite
