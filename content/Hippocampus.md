The **hippocampus** is the part of the human brain that controls **memory formation**. The word "hippocampus" is Latin for sea horse.

The hippocampus stores **explicit memories**, which are of two types:
- **Episodic memories** - *Memories of events* that have transpired. For example, remembering your first day at school where you learnt the basics of calculus is an episodic memory
- **Semantic memories** - *Memories of facts*. Knowing that differentiation in calculus is the instantaneous rate of change is a semantic memory
These memories are called [[Declarative and Procedural Memory|declarative memories]] and are initially conscious memories

Both memories are first stored as **short-term memories**. Over time, some of them become **long-term** memories that are stored in the **neocortex**

## What decides what memories become long-term? 
When we learn something at **first**, it becomes an **episodic** memory - You don't remember *what you learned* but *when you learned it*. Over time, it translates into a **semantic** memory - You now remember *what you learned* rather than *when you learned it*

**Repetition** is the repeated firing of the same neural pathways. **Spaced repetition** is powerful. This is where we **repeatedly activate** the same neural pathways in intervals. That's how we form more **long-term semantic memories**

Spaced repetition is best done in **gradually expanding intervals**

>Much of the short-to-long term memory encoding and memory formation happens dominantly during **sleep**

## The reward system's role
Episodic memories tied to **strong emotions** are more likely going to be encoded into long term memories
These strong emotions -- ranging from extreme pleasure or motivation to depression or stress -- can play an important role in memory formation. After all, we are more inclined to remember the most stressful and painful moments of our lives, and the happiest moments
