Certifications required (EASA, FAA)

There are 8 components that constitute the ecosystem for Urban Air Mobility. Those are:
1. Vehicle design and manufacturing
2. Infrastructure development (Vertiports etc.)
3. Air Traffic Management
4. Safety and Airworthiness
5. Government and Political Support
6. Legal Support
7. Public Acceptance 
8. Integration with Ground Transport

**Public Acceptance**
1. Various people can be affected by UAM - Listen to them
2. *Tangible benefits* offered to the public
	1. Understanding customer needs
	2. Offering social benefits and value
	3. Should be *affordable*, *reliable*, *safe*, and *inclusive*
3. Compliance with the 17 UN Sustainability goals

UAM Ecosystem
* Technological development
* Infrastructure development
* Market traction
* Public acceptance

How to make this a transport solution and integrate UAM into an urban environment?
Airbus came up with an MVP 
1. Vertiport #1 - City integration
2. U-Space - Airspace Integration (U-Space is airspace in an urban setting)
3. eVTOL - CityAirbus NextGen
4. Vertiport #2 - Airport Integration
System-of-systems capability (collation of vertiport systems, airspace, and eVTOL systems into one functioning ecosystem)
The three main pillars are **eVTOLs, U-Space, and Vertiports**
Transversal pillars are *Societal acceptance, regulatory frameworks, UX, and security*

As far as Air Traffic Management (ATM) is concerned, there are quite a few limitations that we have to address
- Only nominal urban operations are allowed - *Further research on this may be required because I don't quite understand this*
- Only VFR - *Visual Flight Rules? What is this?*
- No regulatory frameworks
- Limitations on air & noise pollution
