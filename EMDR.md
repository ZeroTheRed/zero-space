>[!Definition]
>*EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing)* is a form of psychological therapy that helps treat mental health conditions that stem from trauma by *moving your eyes in specific ways*[^1]

The *mind* and *brain* are two distinct entities here
- The *brain* is an organ of your body
- The *mind* is the collective of your thoughts, memories, beliefs, and experiences that *define you*

*Memories + senses* = faster and easier processing

*Adaptive Information Processing (AIP)* -> theory on how the brain *stores memories* = *Normal* and *traumatic* memories are stored d
- **Normal memories** are stored *smoothly* and in a healthy manner
- **Traumatic memories** are not stored properly in the brain. The networking and storage is incomplete due to the trauma and that is comparable to a *wound that isn't allowed to heal completely* -- This affects newer experiences as well

PTSD - The past becomes the present <- improper storage and networking of the memories

## What happens in EMDR?
8 phases 
- **History and info gathering** - What has happened? What are your goals for this therapy? <- getting to know what and how you feel
- **Preparation and education** - Intro and detailing about EMDR and provision of tools to manage your emotions
- **Assessment** - Identify themes and specific memories
- **Desensitization and reprocessing** - Activation of memory by identifying 1+ specific -ve images/thoughts/feelings etc.
- **Installation** - Train focus on the +ve belief
- **Body scan** - What symptoms are you experiencing as you process your memories? Symptoms gone -> reprocessing complete
- **Closure and stabilization** - Between sessions. How to stabilize yourself? 
- **Re-eval and continuing care** - Go over your progress and check in on you. Any adjustments to the therapy process and your goals? Future things to handle?
