>[!Definition]
>**Shot Noise** is noise that is produced due to the **discrete nature** of energetic particles such as _electrons_ and _photons_

**Shot noise** can be observed by ensuring two criteria
1. **Locking particle flow** in **one direction** to isolate out **thermal noise**
2. The **flow** of a given particle must be **random** and **independent** of other particles

Shot noise can be described using **Poisson statistics**
