# Airbus Urban Mobility GmbH

Corporate Start-up under Airbus. How do they form? You need three components
1. Team - Starts with **personal connections**, a common motivation and interest within all members to work on a problem
2. Technology
3. Funding

A corporate start-up is different from a regular start-up in the procedure and meeting yearly targets. In a regular start-up, you may have to go through yearly/bi-annual rounds of funding to continue developing your company and your mission and vision can be fluid. In the corporate equivalent, you are already in a stable net where you follow the standard protocol and functioning and meet yearly company targets

Agile and Lean processes followed. There's a delicate balance to strike between start-up cultures of high engagement and corporate protocols and benefits
