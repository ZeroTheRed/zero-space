# MOC - Neuroscience
**Neuroscience** is defined in Wikipedia as follows

> Neuroscience is the scientific study of the nervous system (the brain, spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system), its functions and disorders

>[!Motivation]+
>- I like pursuing **interdisciplinary** subjects that demand understanding and bringing together several different fields of science. Neuroscience is one such topic. Learning about the brain and the nervous systems requires me to utilize my knowledge of math, statistics, biology, computer science, economics, and psychology, just to name a few. It's a great mental exercise and an enriching learning experience 
>- In a way, studying the brain gives me more valuable insights on maintaining my digital garden, which itself is like a second brain
>- Neuroscience gives me strong and scientific answers to many problems I face in my life - How to improve mental health? What is the reason behind procrastinating? How to remember things? How to become smarter? Why do we get angry, experience love, feel joyous, or envious?
