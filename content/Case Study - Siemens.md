* Image Recognition for defective components
* Edge monetization per image analyzed

Use [[SysML]] to visualize the monetization process and device interaction --> This, in turn, encapsulates the requirements of the products as well

**IoTeria**
_Objective_
Provide a digital marketplace that offers customers a pay-per-use revenue model for them to download and install apps based on what they wish to execute on Cloud and Edge systems in factories
- **Why pay-per-use?** 
	- Easy to scale based on costs
	- The customer is charged proportional to the resources they consume. They don't pay less, they don't pay more than what is required
- **What are the challenges?**
	- Data trust and authentication
	- Find a way to meter the resource consumption (CPU, memory etc)
	- How should the metering data be presented to the user?
