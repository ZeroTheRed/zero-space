Complex problems

## Problem Abstraction
Three classes of probs
- Prediction
	- Estimate future vaules
	- Data and model based
- Optimization
	- Ideal static values
	- Exact methods
	- Heuristics
- Optimal Control
	- Ideal dynamic values
	- Dyn. prog
	- Sim

### Prediction
Find patterns in past data -> generalize to future data

## Optimization
Find values for vars that optimize a function under constraints
Methods: LinProg, ConvexProg, QP
Heuristics: Genetic Algos, Greedy Heur

Delay management 
- delay, reroute, change, reaccommodate

Second-order cone prog (part of convex prog)

*Aircraft Rescheduling with Cruise Speed Control. Operations Research*

Stackelberg Games - *Robust Solutions to Stackelberg games: Addressing bounded rationality and limited observations in human cognition*

## Control
Optimal control given current state of evolving process

DynProg, LQG, **RL**, Agent-based Sim

### DynProg
Go backwards

Steps > Discretize > Time Horizon 

Stagecoach problem
Optim -> static vars

## Accessibility
Visualization is required

- Abstract your problems
- Use different perspectives for approaches to tackle problems
- Importance of accessibility
