>A method of note-taking and knowledge management that relies on taking fleeting and atomic notes with context

## Motivation for Zettelkasten
- To provide contextual information to notes 
- To improve retention of knowledge and note reviews
- To help streamline and denoise the intake of heaps of information
- To provide a structure to my currently chaotic note-taking system
- To create notes that last a lifetime
