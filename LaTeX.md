``Underfull \hbox (badness 10000)``
This error shows up mainly when you are using ``\\`` as a new line. The error message means that LaTeX is creating a horizontal box (hbox) that spans the entire \textwidth and since there's no character in there (not even a whitespace), it's extending for nothing (hence the underfull error). The degree of wastage is indicated by the badness factor, and in this case, is arbitrarily maxed to 10000. 
To prevent this error, use ``\par`` instead of ``\\`` for newlines or line breaks. The ``parskip`` package should help you use that
