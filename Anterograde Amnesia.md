# Anterograde Amnesia

>[!Definition]
>A mental condition described by the total inability to store and/or retrieve memories or new experiences

**Henry Molaison** is a famous example of a person with anterograde amnesia. Having suffered from epilepsy since childhood, he underwent **bilateral medial temporal lobectomy**, a brain surgery procedure where **his hippocampus was removed**. This cured his epilepsy but he was unable to form and retrieve any memory since the operation. He was only able to recall memories of his life prior to the operation

We can pick up new motor skills even with anterograde amnesia

>[!Note]
>Different parts of the brain are used to acquire motor skills and mental skills. As an extension, different parts are used for [[Declarative Memory|declarative]] and [[Procedural Memory|procedural memory]]
