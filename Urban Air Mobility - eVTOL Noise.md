Joby Aviation eVTOLs have 1000x lesser noise (~50 dBA) than conventional helicopters[^1]

## Why does noise happen?
Combine the small diameter of the propeller and the speediness of the propeller blade tips and you get intense high-frequency pressure waves that translate as noise (in airplanes with small propellers)

The nature of the ICEs used to propel most traditional commercial aircraft (burning or "detonating" combustible fuel to produce motion) also delivers extra noise

In helicopters (those with typically large propellers), the length of the propeller diameter, the medium speed of the blade tip, and rotor-wake interaction produces impulsive low-frequency pressure waves, in opposition to those generated by smaller propellers. This form of noise is deeper and more penetrative

So, how would eVTOLs like those produced by Joby produce lesser noise? Combine the noise-suppressive qualities of both airplane and helicopter propellers (large propeller diameter + slow tip speed). The large diameter of the propellers reduces the noise intensity while the slow speed of the blade tips reduces the frequency
