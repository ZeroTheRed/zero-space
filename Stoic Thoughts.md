**Why am I seeking to learn Stoicism?**
I have to develop and boost my emotional and mental resilience. I face a lot of pressure and problems from my family, I am constantly anxious about my future, and my self-confidence is extremely low to the point that I would repeatedly self-loathe, paint a negative picture of everything, and let my fear run amok and control me. Stoicism teaches me to gain control of myself and power through life's many adverse moments 

### Difficulty strengthens the mind, as labour does the body 
* Just as physical exercise strengthens the body and increases endurance, **difficult situations in life** strengthen the mind
	* Builds **resilience**, **wisdom**, and **fortitude**
* See **difficult and stressful situations** as **catalysts for growth and self-improvement** -> a test of your mind -- If you wind up in a tough or distressing moment, treat it as a **training session** to **boost your mental toughness and mind power**
* Everything **stacks up** over time --> Just as even 10 minutes of exercise each day can reap massive benefits in a few months, **small doses of mindfulness** can greatly boost your mindpower. **It's never too late**, keep giving the brain the workout it needs to get better
* The **mind** should be like an **iron wall** -- **impenetrable, strong-willed, and resilient**. After all, **iron is forged** by **subjecting it to extreme conditions** and **hitting it with tools** to produce **the end product**. 

### The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injustice
* **Natural tendency** - Mirror the negative actions of the person or retaliate
	* <span style="color:orange">I get angry at people when I hear something I don't like</span>
	* <span style="color:orange">I lose my calm and temper easily during moments of duress</span>
* When struck with adversity or in the face of wrongdoing, **remain steadfast of your virtue and character** and **not choose to strike back in retaliation**
* Under duress, **remain true to yourself**

### We cannot choose our external circumstances, but we can always choose how we respond to them
* You **cannot control or influence external situations or people** but **you have full power over your internal mind**
	* You can <span style="color:blueviolet">change your view of the situation</span>
	* You can <span style="color:blueviolet">exert ultimate control over your internal fortress</span> and <span style="color:blueviolet">maintain inner peace and stability</span>
* **Mental resilience and toughness**

### Fire tests gold, suffering tests brave men
* Just as subjecting gold to fire is a test of purification, **life's difficult challenges** and **the suffering that comes with it** is a test for you to **discover and strengthen your mind and resilience**
* [[Growth Mindset|Stress is enhancing]] - Tough moments level you up. The suffering empowers you. **See the worst of life in a different perspective**

### It is not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters

### If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid

### No man is free who is not master of himself
