1. I am a mirror. Do good to me and I'll do good to you. Be a pain and I'll be a pain too
2. It's going to take more than a nuclear bomb to set me back
3. The only thing that gives me more dopamine than a video game is proving you wrong
4. I am a powerful being in my own right - Temporary setbacks and annoyances are nothing to me
