# Abstract Thinking

>[!Definition]
>Thinking about non-physical entities, concepts, and general ideas

**Abstract** thinking involves coming up with *higher-order ideas and connections*. Abstract thinkers also think *metaphorically and creatively*. The opposite of abstract thinking is [[Concrete Thinking]]

### Features of abstract thinking
* **Metaphorical interpretation** - Abstract thinkers often think in *metaphors*. This way, they [[Associative Thinking|implicitly connect concepts]] to compare and understand similarities between them. Examples would be "This guy is a walking encyclopaedia" or "Reality is a simulation"
* **Pattern Recognition** - Symbolic patterns are easily recognised by abstract thinkers. They are the ones who can observe chains of events, groups of somewhat unrelated objects, and identify trends and patterns in them all
* **Generalization** - Abstract thinkers can observe and develop general rules and principles to govern specific examples that they have come across, which they will attempt to apply in other fields
* **Non-physical ideas** - Happiness, freedom, romance, creativity, humour, logic, and surrealism are just some of the many non-physical entities that abstract thinkers love to juggle with. They are heavy conceptual thinkers. They think about the *why* and less about the *how*

Something that I found while reading about abstract thinking is its role in anxiety and depression. When we think abstract, we tend to snap to the worst possible outcome and experience intense anxiety. How so? We are subconsciously forming [[Hasty Generalization|hasty generalizations]] and ill-informed patterns from limited experiences. Do you see where I'm going with this one? Overthinking is a common trait in such people

Moreover, I think abstract thinkers are sometimes detached from reality, which can often blind them to the physical world. We may have a practically simple solution right in front of us and yet we struggle to enact it. We choose the more complicated route (albeit one with more meaning and depth to it, mostly). A rich but ultimately suboptimal move. 

### Tools to improve abstract thinking
* **Think about the "why"** - Don't just focus on the practical execution of something. Think why the solution matters. Think about why a particular goal matters to you. Seek meaning and purpose 
* **Reframe your thinking** - Whenever you're stuck with a problem, it greatly helps to shift your perspective and think about it from a different angle. This is called cognitive reframing. You may even rephrase the question or problem statement and come up with more perspectives. What are any alternatives? Why is this the way it is? How would a different person see this? 
* **Focus on the big picture** - Don't get caught up in the details and the smaller worlds. Zoom out and take a helicopter perspective on the whole. Find the big picture. See how things connect and show up as a singular entity
