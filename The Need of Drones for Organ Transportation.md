# The Need of Drones for Organ Transportation

In the USA, the **number of lung transplants/year** doubled from <span style="color:lightsalmon">23000</span> in the year 2000 to <span style="color:chartreuse">46632</span> in 2023[^1]
##### What drove the growth?
* Policy changes
* Advancements in medical technology 
	* Transport containers that can **pump blood and oxygen** to organs to maximize lifespan - time extended from **6-hour standard limit**
##### What are the challenges now?
* The **increased demand** for organ transplants needs **more vehicles and drivers** to transport them in limited time
* Currently, **conventional aircraft**, **helicopters**, and **ground vehicles** do the transport work
##### What companies/universities are working on this?
* **BETA Technologies, Vermont**
	* **Electric ALIA air taxis**[^2] - **United Therapeutics** is requesting the ALIA drones for lung transport
		* ALIA drones are **fixed-wing drones** - *Resistant to bad weather*
* **Unither Biotechnologies**, a subsidiary of United Therapeutics
* **Longitude Mobility** - Advises aviation companies on transporting human organs
* **Unither Bioelectronics** - In 2021, a lung was transported from end-to-end using a drone[^3]
