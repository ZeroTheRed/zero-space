Principles
- Safe operations
- Universal access
- Scalable

- Competition

- Implementation
	- Foundation
		- E-reg, E-ID (ID and tracking)
		- Geofencing (Airspace mgmt.)
	- Initial
		- Support management
			- Flight planning, approve, track (Mission mgmt.)
	- Advanced
		- Complex support
			- Capacity mgmt., conflict det, det and avoid (DAA) (Conflict mgmt., Emergency mgmt.)
