* Flip situations over the head by looking at them from a different perspective. Turn your thinking around
* It is during the toughest moments that we should smile
* Never give up and doggedly pursue your objective, no matter what it takes
* Stand up for yourself and don't let others affect you negatively
* _The only time a lawyer can cry is when it's all over_ - Until and unless you are certain you have exhausted all options and have totally failed 100%, never let yourself down and keep the fight going
* Always pay close attention to what people are saying, their words, their tones, their body language. That can tell you a lot of them and can help you uncover contradictions
* You are not lesser than anybody
