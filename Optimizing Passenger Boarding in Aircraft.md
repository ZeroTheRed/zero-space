### Technical Blueprint (Feasibility)
Data Analysis, Simulations, Augmented Reality, IoT
* Collect datasets - Simulations of passengers boarding (gate -> aircraft)
* Use IoT tech to speed up passenger boarding - [Boarding 4.0](https://www.techscience.com/iasc/v35n3/49357/html)
	* Passengers can be visually guided to their seats on their mobiles -> Show shortest route and alternatives - **Augmented Reality (AR)**
	* Sensors in overhead bins -> Show passengers the nearest empty bins with space to place their luggage
* **Machine Learning** can be used to come up with optimal **routing algorithms** (so far, reverse pyramid and Steffen methods are effective but AI/ML have been shown to provide far more effective methods than people thought up of in other fields)
