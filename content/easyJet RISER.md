In 2015, **easyJet** conducted a successful trial of deploying the **RISER quadcopter** to **perform inspections and safety checks** of **Airbus A380 aircraft**[^1]

RISER was developed by **Blue Bear** and **Createc**
**RISER** - Remote Intelligence Survey Equipment for Radiation
- Electro-optical, light detection, and ranging sensors
- **7-laser system** by **Ametek** for the inspection[^2]
#### Method of Operation
1. RISER was programmed to **follow a preset flight path to scan the aircraft**
2. The drone would **capture and record images and video of any defect**
3. RISER maintained a **safe distance of 1 m from the aircraft body at all times** using a **2-laser IR system**[^2]
