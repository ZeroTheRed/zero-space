>[!What is neuroplasticity]
>The ability of the brain to change and reconfigure itself. Neuroplasticity can also be a measure of the brain's resilience factor -- How efficiently can the brain recover from damage or duress?

Neuroplasticity is high during childhood and although it reduces into adulthood, it still persists

There are two commonly discussed types of neuroplasticity

## Structural Neuroplasticity (SN)
SN is when the neuronal structure changes. More neurons can be formed, some neurons may be destroyed, and synaptic connections emerge or disappear

## Functional Neuroplasticity (FN)
FN is when neurons change or readapt their functionality. While SN is the change in the density of neurons and how they are reorganized in quantity and strength, FN concerns itself with the properties of neurons. Example: A neuron that used to take up function A would now take up function B instead

There are several types of FN
1. **Homologous Area Adaptation** - When a part of the brain suffers damage, the portion of the brain *homologous* (symmetric in function) to the damaged part will take up that part's function. Consequently, the portion of the brain will be "multi-tasking" but at the cost of reduced performance of both activities because there now aren't many neurons to sufficiently accommodate the complete spectrum
2. **Compensatory Masquerade** - This is simply a section of the brain performing the functions of another. As the type's name suggests, the section "masquerades" itself as the damaged section. For example, a blind person would now use sound directions to figure out where they are located
4. **Cross-modal Reassignment** - A section of the brain normally wired to process a particular input/group of inputs is reconfigured to accept different classes of inputs. This is possible because the electrochemical impulses are the same regardless of the input type, and all follow the same fundamental rules of change
5. **Map Expansion** - The section of the brain under focus will expand its capabilities to neighbouring sections. If a particular section of the brain is in high demand/use, it expands to account for it
