>A **digital twin** is an **accurate** and **one-to-one** **virtual representation** of a physical entity[^1]
# How does it work?
A digital twin functions using several working methods
1. **Collecting real-world data via sensors** - Sensors attached to a physical object can extract data about the object's performance, the variables it is measuring, and its health etc. The aggregated data can be applied to the digital twin where the model can: 
	1. **Reverse-process** the data and simulate the working of the entity. **For example**: *one can collect the aerodynamic performance and data of an aircraft, data associated with its usage of fuel, data on its trajectory and flight patterns, and data on the passenger distribution to produce a **digital "what if" twin** of the same aircraft -- How the aircraft would actually be **if the current data were to be the correct data**. The **differences between this digital twin and the physical object** being twinned can deliver important insights, patterns, and pointers as to improving the performance and functionality of the aircraft*
	2. **Make inferences and decisions**. This is similar to the idea of sensor fusion, where data fused from multiple sensors can provide us with unique insights and models. 
	An [[Internet of Things (IoT)|IoT]] cluster is a great tool to acquire data and information of the physical object

A digital twin is pretty much exactly what it's called -- It is a **two-way** twin of the physical entity. Both **exist in synergy**. The physical object and its digital twin track each other. For example, the object provides data to the twin and the twin returns back insights. 

# Benefits of Digital Twins
1. **Holistic Assessment** - Unlike simulations, which focus on select aspects of an entity, a digital twin is a virtual copy of the entire object and its environment itself. This allows for a thorough and well-rounded evaluation and modelling of the real object, taking all the data and the interplay between parameters into consideration. This *uncovers more powerful insights normally hidden from view in standard simulations*
2. **Real Time** - The digital twin, being a one-to-one virtual copy of the physical entity, is constantly updated with data from the entity's sensors to track it. Most standard simulations don't necessarily function in real time but digital twins do

>[!Attention]
>Digital twins are only useful for large-scale projects such as automobile and aircraft production, manufacturing, power utilities, and building construction. The creation of digital twins is too complex and costly for small-scale projects


# Types of Digital Twins
This is based on the level of magnification (top -- unit-level. bottom -- full factory level)
