# Remote repair of automobiles using drones and IoT - Smart cities


2025 - Global UAV market to top $63 billion

* Take GPS location of broken vehicle + vehicle data (battery charge, tire pressure levels, fuel levels etc)
* Drone dispatched to take pictures of the broken vehicle and send live video feed to the remote operator
* The drone can carry basic tools and spare parts with it that cover most generic cases of repair and maintenance
* The operator can control the drone's actions 
* Comms attachment to vehicle to gather telemetry data and talk to the remote repair centre to launch drones - also used for cost analysis

#### What value does it provide?
1. **Remote servicing and repairs** - The user doesn't have to worry about the vehicle being broken down in the middle of a highway because the repair drone can get to it anywhere and quickly
2. **Reduced downtime** - The reduction in time is because aerial vehicles can reach the destination faster than road vehicles (not bound by land obstacles)
3. **Availability of vehicle data** - The more data obtained and collected on vehicles, the greater the quality of future repairs. AI models can be trained on the dataset that is collected like this
4. **Enhanced Emergency Response** - This is particular very helpful during major accidents and when important vehicles have taken damage such as ambulances
5. **Reduced costs** - Simpler logistics because you don't have to send an entire repair crew over long distances
#### How is it scalable?
* **Start small, scale up** - Drone technology is highly scalable. You can start out with smaller drones covering lighter repairs and eventually scale up depending on the need
* **Highly adaptable** - The drone repair model can be customized and expanded to different vehicles

#### How is it sustainable?
* **Reduced Carbon Footprint**
