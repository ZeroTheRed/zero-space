> 2023 saw a massive uptick in commercial aviation, greater than pre-pandemic levels. 

It appears that the world has bounced back from the shock of COVID-19. Aviation is an important field that needs to keep operating. No wonder that it has experienced a surge. More people are wanting to travel and connect to other parts of the world after being quarantined within their homes for months!

### Main drivers for the upsurge of defence in the USA?
- **New geopolitical challenges** - Wherever any geopolitical tension arises, whether it directly or indirectly concerns the USA, they will require active deployment of their defence systems. Along with, an increased demand for aviation will be necessary to keep up with. *Wars and tensions can be profitable for a country*
- **Need for modernization** - In order to match up with the armies of other countries (more often than not, including rivals and enemies), USA needs to boost their defence technologies. They know they're going to need a visibly strong force multiplier

### What can we expect for 2024?
- **Demand for A&D will continue into 2024**
	- Travel demand will continue increasing
		- Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) is advancing testing and certification as they are moving rapidly towards commercialization and operations
	- Defence product demand is proportional to geopolitical instability
		- Defence expenditures will see an upshot due to the increased requirements
		- Aircraft orders and fleet purchases are increasing thanks to continued investments from the AAM and space industries
- We are seeing new **product innovations** in the field of A&D that incorporate enhanced technology, greater [[Sustainability|sustainability]], and lower costs
	- Supersonic and hypersonic flights, material developments, and advanced manufacturing are good examples. [[Industry 4.0]] is a key element in A&D
	- Advanced Air Mobility is experienced strong and evergreen developments in different countries such as Germany, Japan, China, and USA
	- [[Unmanned Aerial Vehicle - Basics|UAVs]] are becoming increasingly popular and a lot of innovations are happening with these
	- Current and hot fields of technology in A&D are AI, microelectronics, advanced propulsion, quantum technology, advanced computing. Plenty of supply chain optimizations are being planned this year
- **Cyber-resiliency** is an important factor that is gaining traction. Security and integrity are extremely crucial for the functioning of almost all A&D systems. Maintaining robustness against cyberattacks and bouncing back to normal operation in less time may just turn out to be the key factor for everything

### Challenges and Hurdles to face
- **Supply Chain Problems**
	- India's own supply chain problems - Defects on US Pratt & Whitney engines, old and dated aircraft, and supply not meeting demand
- **Longer Lead Times**
	- There is a strong need for quick prototyping, certification, and commercialization. Time to adopt the [[Digital Thread]]
- **Talent Shortage** - The A&D industry, in my opinion, requires a lot of generalists and not just specialists alone. Many people aren't working on gaining knowledge and skills in different fields. There isn't much focus on interdisciplinary thinking and people are only hyperfocusing on specific career paths. It also doesn't help that A&D generally doesn't pay much and there's weak work-life balance
- **Conservativeness and lack of digitalization**
	- US FAA's 30-year old NOTAM software is 6 years behind upgrading
		- NOTAM database malfunction led to FAA implementing the first countrywide suspension of air traffic in 20 years
	- Class-action lawsuit against Southwest Airlines due to their holiday meltdown at the end of December 2022(?) during severe weather
		- They were using software dated to the 1990s
		- Scheduling system problems and lack of immunity to system upgrades
