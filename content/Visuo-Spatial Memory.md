>Visuo-spatial memory is a type of working memory that crosses spatial and visual awareness with how we interact with the environment using the combination of our eyes and our limbs

A strong visual memory allows you to
- Rapidly create mental snapshots of events. It's like an IR camera -- people with strong mental snapshots can visualize and see what others can't
- Identify complex patterns 
- Extract meaningful information
- Differentiate between relevant and irrelevant information
