# Divergent Thinking


>[!Definition]
>The type of thinking that involves generating ideas and different thoughts without limitation

**Divergent thinking** is highly *spontaneous* and *free-flowing*. Brainstorming and mindmaps are great examples of divergent thinking 

The crux of divergence is the production of ideas. One can sit and come up with numerous thoughts and ideas in a given time period. They need not always make sense or be practical and they need not necessarily be connected

You take a problem and you generate several possible solutions to it
You take a question and you generate several alternate ways to reframe the same question 

Use convergent thinking to put together the ideas produced by divergent thinking

Too much divergent thinking can be bad for your mental health - Schizophrenia?
