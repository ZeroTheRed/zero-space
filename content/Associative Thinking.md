>*Associative thinking* is the process of *connecting seemingly unrelated concepts* together and forming relationships between ideas

The *medial temporal lobe* is thought to be responsible for associative memory and thinking

There are two distinct types of associative memory
1. **Implicit memory** - An unconscious memory process that relies on *priming*. Relationships are forged between entities subconsciously when they are presented simultaneously or in quick succession. Implicit association is driven by internal factors such as *performance*, *habituation*, and *thalamic processing speed*. An example would be *a song <-> its lyrics <-> the environment in which the song is being heard*
3. **Explicit memory** - Explicit association is the conscious connection of entities. This is *explainable* unlike implicit association. An example would be ->.*Paris <-> France (The former is the capital city of the latter)*
	1. **Episodic explicit association** - The relationship between "episodes" or events 
	2. **Semantic explicit association** - The relationship between facts 

The [[Hippocampus]] stores explicit memories, so it might play an important role in associative thinking along with the medial temporal lobe

>*Priming* is the process of exposing an entity to a person and then making them form an association between this and the next entity being presented

## Tools to improve associative memory and thinking
1. **Network of associations** - Spend time with people who can connect the dots well and model their approach
2. **Ad hoc association** - Readily establish connections between random objects, some way or the other. It can be as a song, a rhyme, or a fact, or an indirect connection (connection through a couple of other entities)
3. **Create a story** - If you're having trouble remembering the associations, make a story containing them. Stories are easier to remember. It's a form of *Elaborative Encoding*
4. **Connected lists** - Remember only the beginning of a list. This works when you can associate the beginning to everything else in said list
