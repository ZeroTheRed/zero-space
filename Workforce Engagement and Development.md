# Workforce Engagement and Development

>[!Motivation]
>- I know that I'm going to be a part of the world's workforce. As a worker myself, I think I may benefit a lot by understanding my needs and what is expected of me to contribute to the development of the world
>- Good leaders develop their workforce and support them all the way through. If I imagine myself as a leader, what do I need to know about how to improve the workforce and how can I make it happen?
### Notes
The workforce is a crucial component of an industry/business. You can't do crap without people making it happen, and people aren't mindless machines. I think workforce engagement is important. Getting the morale, motivation, and skills of people boosted is what gets things going

How can that be done?
- **Learning and Development** - Workers can undergo apprenticeships and internships, take up extended competencies and focus on lifelong acquiring and learning of soft and hard skills. Be the eternal student and continue becoming a better version of yourself
- **Empowerment and Ownership** - People function at their best when they are granted a degree of autonomy in making decisions. We have our unique opinions and perspectives that we wish to contribute and implement, for which autonomy is a must
- **Networking** - We are fundamentally social beings, and networking with our peers is the foundation for success at everything. Workers should aim towards connecting with their colleagues, forming teams composed of people with different backgrounds and skillsets who can function across different disciplines, and networking with those out of their field as well
- **Impact and Recognition** - Workers must be motivated for them to give it their best shot. They must take accountability for their achievements, own them, and celebrate. Every person's work and contributions are important, no matter how small or big
- **Workers' Voices** - Digital channels and proper procedures for communication have to be established in place so that workers can talk about the issues and roadblocks they are facing, and express their interests, both in the short and long run
