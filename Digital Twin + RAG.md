What if it is possible to borrow ideas from [[Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)]] and apply it to a [[Digital Twin]]?

The idea is to *modularize* the digital twin and enable *dynamic updates* to it. The motivation behind this is encapsulated by a simple question

> If the physical entity has changed itself, how can the digital twin update itself to remain accurate in mirroring the former without the need to rewrite the simulation code altogether?

The process can be summarized as follows:
### Retrieval Mechanism
* The digital twin can *retrieve new data collected from sensors* installed in the environment of the physical entity. The new data is collected and *integrated into a knowledge base*

### Augmented Generation
- The retrieved data is used to *selectively update* only the parts of the digital twin that require updating to match the physical entity. Essentially, the digital twin *updates its knowledge base to correspond accurately to the physical entity*

### Feedback Loop
- The digital twin continues to *monitor the physical entity* in *real-time*, dynamically updating itself as and when changes are made to the latter
