>[!Extropy]
Extropy is simply the opposite of entropy. Max More defines extropy as "The extent of a living or organizational system's *intelligence*, *functional order*, *vitality*, *energy*, *life*, *experience*, and *capacity and drive for improvement and growth*"[^1]

### Principles of Extropianism
It is the most developed subset of transhumanism and it preaches **practical optimism about the future**. Reasoning, science, and technology are important elements in extropianism

The eventual goal is to understand limits imposed upon humankind by external factors such as nature and **surpass them** by augmenting and **improving human life and conditioning**. In turn, the increased human condition helps uncover, understand, and harness more of what the universe has to offer, further strengthening humankind's reach

Self-evaluation and openness to criticism are essential. Extropians should strive to search for the truth and be more than willing to course-correct themselves when required. **Metacognition** is the tool
