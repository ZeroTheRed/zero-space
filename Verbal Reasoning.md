## Motivation
To improve verbal reasoning skills and be able to effectively and easily read through papers, books, and articles. I also want to practise my critical thinking and reading skills, such that I should be able to read an article and form my own opinions based on the information presented as text

I took a GMAT sample test of 9[^1] questions of which each set of 3 questions focused on verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and data insights. I wasn't exactly sure about the clear difference between quants and data insights because both categories felt mathematical and number-crunchy. I performed good in quants save for a silly mistake I made because I was rushing. Here's my score breakdown

| Verbal | Quantitative | Data |
| ------ | ------------ | ---- |
| 0      | 2            | 1    |

I seem to be pretty weak in data insights but looking back, the answers were simple. However, verbal reasoning trumped me substantially and even the logic behind the solutions seemed convoluted to me. 

**Tips**
1. *See the suggested view/options first, then look at the paragraph*. Why does that work? Knowing the conclusion of the argument and the possible answers, you can focus and filter meaning out of the paragraph that can either support or discredit the view. Doing it the other way around (the procedural way) is also fine but you'd have to distil the key points from the paragraph by yourself without any objective and you'll have to remember them while evaluating them against the view and the options
2. *Stick only to the paragraph*. In other words, forget what you know already and treat the paragraph as the sole source of knowledge and information that you need to know. This works with tests but in general, external knowledge helps give the text more nuance and meaning
3. *Detect paraphrasing* in the views and options. A good vocabulary is required to improve paraphrasing and detection ability
