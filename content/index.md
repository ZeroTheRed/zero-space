## Hello there! 

I am Tushar, and you are entering my [[Digital Garden]] and personal wiki

This site takes up multiple forms
- **Braindump/Wiki** - Anything interesting and cool that I'm learning will be recorded here
- **Blog** - You will find my thoughts and musings, which I post sporadically
- **Archive** - Awesome YouTube videos, websites, second brains, books, and songs will be found here. If you're looking for recommendations and want a peek into my personal tastes, you'll find the archive fun

>[!Note]
>My digital garden is quite unpolished and haphazard. If you see half-complete, cryptic, and scattershot arrangements of my notes, that's because it's a work-in-progress. Also, this is more of my attempt of **learning in public**
>

With that said, enjoy my garden! 

## How to navigate my garden?
Utilize the search bar located at the top to look for anything that interests you. The explorer pane on the left side (which seems to be visible only when you're accessing my website from desktop, oddly) gives you a list of all notes I have in my garden

Down below is a set of Maps of Content (MOC), which serve as indices for you to navigate into specific topics. Feel free to choose either option. I'm working on ways to make navigation easier but that isn't a top priority right now

## Braindump
You're welcome to surf through my brain-dump. Much like a wiki, I'm assembling a network of concepts and topics that I'm learning/have learned

- [[Psychology and Neuroscience]]
- [[Philosophical Stuff]]
- [[Future Technology]]

>[!Todo]
>- [[Aircraft and Spacecraft]]
>- [[Robotics]]
>- [[Technology - General, Emergent, and Disruptive]]
>- [[Doom Mapping]]
