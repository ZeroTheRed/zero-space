IWAD: Doom 2
Levels: MAP01-32
Author: Zero the Red
Tentative Release Date: Undecided (probably a year or so)
Compatibility: Boom-compatible (cl9) or UDMF but most likely will stick to Boom. MBF21 is a good option to explore

This megawad will be heavily sci-fi themed. The thematic progression will start with space stations and futuristic environments, and will eventually proceed to Helltech -- Hell but completely modernized. I don't plan to add much nature stuff in here, partly because designing nature-inspired areas is not my forte, and partly because that may conflict with the intended overarching theme. 
All levels will be named after mathematical terms. Why did I choose to do this? 
- Not many Doom WADs I have seen really touched that theme of naming levels. Not a stupendously signficant point to ponder upon but I thought it would be neat to go for something unique here
- Math-based names sound cool, there's no contest on this thought!
- It may be a fun exercise to insert something related to the mathematical concept a level is named after, inside the level. For example, MAP01 - Matrix Mechanics may either feature a huge platformer section that looks like a matrix on the automap, and may feature a few ladders as a reference to ladder operators used often. MAP22 - Torture Tensor will be a Helltech level that may showcase plenty of geometric contraptions that represent select monsters or weapons (or geometrically intricate regions that are optimized for usage of a particular weapon), much like how tensors are algebraic objects that can represent physical quantities.
