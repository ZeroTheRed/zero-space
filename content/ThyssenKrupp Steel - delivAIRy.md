In 2019, ThyssenKrupp Steel demonstrated its first official UAV flight for transporting lab samples[^1]

<span style="color:red">What's the main problem?</span> - Presently, an employee drives to the plant's Schwelgern port 2x a day to collect lab samples (coking coal, iron ore etc.) to the testing plant. The car path crosses unprotected railway crossings - *a safety issue* <- **Drones can ease the travel**

ThyssenKrupp partnered with doks.innovation GmbH (the creator of delivAIRy drones). The drones have patented **autonomous load pickup** functionality[^1]
