The train operated between *Osaka* and *Amagasaki* in Japan and was operated by *JR West*
Starting at the JR West Hanaten office, Ryujiro Takami gives his departure roll call at 6:21 am to begin work

His allocated train was a 7-car 207 series electric unit and goes to Hanaten to pick up passengers. Assigned number upon departure was 218s on the Katamachi line to Matsui Yamata station

There were a series of delays, all between 40 seconds to 1 minute 20 seconds. Moreover, at the end station, the train had overshot the rear limit marker by about 8 m (actual overrrun distance was 72 km) and the driver had to reverse the train

Passengers were knocking on the window and demanding an apology announcement, which Ryujiro made. He asked the train conductor "Will you forgive my mistake?" to which he was silent

The train was then approaching a curve with a 70 km/h speed limit and the train itself was running at 116 km/h. The derailment happened here. 

562 injuries and 107 deaths (including the driver, Ryujiro)

## Technical analysis
There were air conditioning systems housed over the roofs of the train compartments. The AC systems were as heavy as the bottom frames of the cars. They contributed to the derailment by adding to a loss of balance. The newer cars were equipped with data recorders to record the control state of the train such as when brakes were applied and for how long. 

Why did the ATS (Automated Train Stop) system not trigger this time like it did before? The line on which the train had operated had the oldest ATS system installed by JR West

The focus of the investigation was Ryujiro himself (who was dead by now). Why would we risk derailment and thus, mass deaths, but trying to mitigate a delay as small as a little less than a minute? 

This gives us a glimpse into Japan's toxic work culture, notably the public transport system, where people expect zero delays whatsoever.
Drivers were subject to severe verbal abuse and were forced to write reports repenting their mistakes. If drivers had failed and had generated delays, then they were put under a punitive day-shift training. Lack of sleep and self-care is a common aspect of workers
