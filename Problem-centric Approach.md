* Identify an existing problem or challenge
* Analyse **why** the challenge is worth pursing
* Reframe the problem by using **frame-storming**
* Analyse **what** are the causes of the problem -> fishbone diagrams
* Come up with solutions for **how** you will address the causes of the problem

### How is it great?
* It helps in understanding the problem domain deeply. Because you're analysing the problem in-depth, you are bound to accumulate knowledge and gain experience on what the problem domain entails
* You tailor solutions to specific issues. You focus on the challenge and you precisely come up with solutions to address said issue
* This exercise enhances my critical thinking and creativity under limits. If I'm given a particular problem, how would I go about this? 

### How does it break down?
* Problem-centric approaches are not the best for innovation because you are restricting your thinking to only a specific problem. For innovation, you must explore the potential of technologies and see how it can be vital to solving multiple problems. In other words, you should take it from the reverse direction
* Going with this approach is flawed if you do not possess a deep and thorough understanding of the problem domain itself
