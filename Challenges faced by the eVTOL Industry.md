## Overall Aircraft Design
1. Aeromechanic simulation and optimization
2. Trade-offs on overall aircraft level
3. Holistic optimization of 3 innovation pillars
	1. Redundant distributed lift generation
	2. Fully electric propulsion system
	3. Highly automated fly-by-wire controld

## Reliable Lightweight Structure
1. Novel eVTOL structure concepts
2. Weight impact studies for distributed, redundant load paths (no single point of failure) - *Electric batteries don't get noticeably lighter during flight unlike conventionally powered aircraft, so that is important to take into due consideration*
3. Integration of electric energy storage and propulsion
4. Crash analysis
5. Structural and dynamic testing of airframe components up to permit-to-fly substantiation

## Electric Propulsion System
1. Optimised architecture of electrical system including trade-offs on overall aircraft level 
2. Dynamic testing of propulsion unit and beams 
3. Reliability, failure scenarios, cooling concepts (permit-to-fly)

## Flight Controls and Dynamics
1. Test bench and automated testing
2. Versatile hardware platform: backup flight control module (permit-to-fly)
3. Passenger comfort perception

## Production, Integration, Flight Testing
1. Manufacturing and assembly of vehicle components
2. System and component tests for airworthiness
3. Aircraft zero with integration of all units
4. Flight testing with pilot onboard
5. Demo of performance and mission capability
