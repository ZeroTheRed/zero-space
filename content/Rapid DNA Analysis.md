>**Rapid DNA analysis** is the process of automating the identification of a person using their DNA samples and constructing their profile[^2]

Taking a look at Richard Selden's ANDE machine[^1] 
1. A [[Buccal Swab|buccal swab]] is performed to extract the *DNA sample*
2. The sample is then loaded into the machine, which *passes the sample through an "obstacle course"* by *washing it with water*. The DNA sticks to the filter while the rest is washed away, and *air pressure blasts the purified sample* into a *reconstitution chamber*  where the sample is *shocked* with 6000 V of electricity
3. In the end, the machine *reads specific genome regions* of the sample and *constructs an allele profile* with different peaks for each allele. The peak patterns are then compared with existing DNA profiles to identify blood relations
## Examples of rapid DNA analysis manufacturers
1. ANDE
2. IntegenX
3. RapidHIT

## Where is this used?
1. **Law Enforcement** - To trace people's identities and blood relations, to build criminal and suspect profiles, and to maintain records
2. **Immigration Control** - To build migrant profiles and catch potential suspects, to catch family unit frauds
3. **Defence and Intelligence** - To combat terrorism and speed up intelligence operations
