Antibiotics work by **binding onto specific sites** of the **target**, thus stalling or stopping the target cell/enzyme's activity

Recently, **Multiplex Genome Engineering (MAGE)** has been used to produce **various combinations** of naturally occurring mutant possibilities of the bacteria E. Coli in an attempt to develop more potent antibiotics. 

**One of the major issues** with antibiotics is their inability to bind to the targets of mutant bacteria because the mutants vary and evolve over time to develop higher resistance against the effects of the antibiotics
