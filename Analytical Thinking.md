# Analytical Thinking

>[!Definition]+
>**Analytical thinking** is the type of thinking that involves solving problems by breaking them down into smaller components and working through them using *deductive reasoning* and no prior knowledge about the subject

*Pattern recognition* is a frequent theme in analytical reasoning. The way such thinkers proceed is to identify common trends and patterns across the problem domain they are focusing on, after breaking down the problem into smaller parts that are easier to process
