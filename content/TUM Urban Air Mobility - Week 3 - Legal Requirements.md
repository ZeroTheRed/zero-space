EU laws - Rachel Junemann, legal consultant for the Federal Ministry of Digital and Transport

The purpose of laws here is to *standardize* the procedures and requirements for drones to operate and for providing support to *integrate* unmanned systems into the existing ecosystem. Everybody likes drones and more and more people are beginning to use them, so rules and regulations must be put in place

**EU Regulation 2019/947** classified drones into 3 categories
- **Open** 
	- Take-off mass of < 25 kg
	- Flight altitude of < 120 m
	- LoS of remote pilot required
	- Safe distance from people
	- Overflight of crowds not allowed
	- Dangerous goods transport is not allowed
	- No operating license is required to fly the drone. However, the pilot should possess a certificate of competence (EU Cert. of Competence/EU Remote Pilot Certificate)
- **Specific**
	- This is important if the open category requirements are not met
	- Operation can be performed only after a thorough risk assessment and approval by a competent authority. Applications to the locally responsible aviation authority (LBI)
	- Quite complicated 
- **Certified**
	- Overflight of crowds is allowed (can fly over massive crowds)
	- Dangerous goods may be transported
	- Passengers can also be present inside the drone (on-board) - Not present now but this is a future-ready thing
	- It's challenging to get a certificate to pilot a drone in this category

Upon registering, an operator will receive a unique electronic registration number called an *EID number* that they can attach to their drones. All drones are subject to mandatory insurance to cover for potential damages
