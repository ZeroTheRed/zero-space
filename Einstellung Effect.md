# Einstellung Effect

>[!Definition]
>The **Einstellung effect** is the phenomenon where we tend to apply solutions and interpretations **based on what we are familiar with and previously successful solutions** despite more efficient and optimal solutions existing

Adopting a healthy [[Growth Mindset]] counters the Einstellung effect

**How is it a problem?**
* *It impedes* [[Problem Solving]]. We are predisposed to applying familiar solutions and practices to modern problems, which may be complex or different in nature. This limits our ability to think more creatively and attack the problem from multiple directions
* *It increases arrogancy and stubbornness*. When we are overconfident and fiercely adamant on believing that what has always worked for us is the correct solution, we are setting ourselves towards a path of failure. It's the opposite of being open-minded and it may end up harming relationships because you refuse to consider other perspectives and thoughts

**How to tackle it?**
* _Awareness_ - Know and understand the negative impact of the Einstellung effect. This calls for self-awareness and being attentive of your mindset as you approach a problem
* *Deconstruction* - Break down the problem into smaller subproblems. Subproblems are more easily manageable and it's more convenient to attack a smaller problem from multiple perspectives than you would for a bigger one. Huge problems can mess the mind up and we tend to fall back to scripted and stagnated perspectives out of confusion and lack of direction
* *Mindfulness* - To reinforce point 1, mindfulness is important
	* Meditation
	* Yoga
	* Deep breathing
	* Journaling
	* Focus on the present 
* [[Divergent Thinking]] - Generate a wide array of different solutions to a problem. This aspect is related to abstract thinking and it helps boost creativity and to counter tunnel vision
* *Seeking alternatives* - Gather feedback from other people about your solution/work. Obtain various perspectives and new insights
