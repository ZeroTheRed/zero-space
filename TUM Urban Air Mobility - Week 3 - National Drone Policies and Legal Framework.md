# TUM Urban Air Mobility - Week 3 - National Drone Policies and Legal Framework

The structure of the national drone policy is as follows
- [[TUM Urban Air Mobility - Week 3 - National Drone Policies and Legal Framework#Goals of the Government|Goals of the Federal Government]] - The objectives must always be clearly laid out before proceeding to the next step. They provide the direction to focus on
- [[TUM Urban Air Mobility - Week 3 - National Drone Policies and Legal Framework#European and National Legislation towards UAS|European and National Legislation towards UAS]] - After underlining the *goals*, what's the next step? To understand what can be done within the established law. For that, is it important to review the EU law 
- [[TUM Urban Air Mobility - Week 3 - National Drone Policies and Legal Framework#New UAM concepts|New UAM concepts]] - Once the *goals* are underscored and awareness about the *law* on UAM is obtained, it is time to see what we can do with UAM and how to implement it into reality from concept
- [[TUM Urban Air Mobility - Week 3 - National Drone Policies and Legal Framework#Geographical Zones|Geographical Zones]] - The *goals* direct you, the *law* tells you your scope, the *concepts* show you what you can do to realize the goals, an understanding of the geographical zones shows you *where* you can apply it all
- [[TUM Urban Air Mobility - Week 3 - National Drone Policies and Legal Framework#U-Space|U-Space and U-Space Reality Lab]] - This may be an implementation of a Digital Twin. If so, this is an important connection between Industry 4.0 and Advanced Air Mobility
- Lessons Learned

### Goals of the Government
- Become the **leading market in the EU** with **high safety standards**
- Protect **personal data**, privacy, and the **environment**
- Put automated and interconnected flying into practice

### European and National Legislation towards UAS
These are the EU regulations that have to be followed
- [Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 on common rules of civil aviation ](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32018R1139)
- [Regulation (EU) 2019/947 on the rules and procedures for the operation of unmanned aircraft](https://skybrary.aero/articles/regulation-2019947-rules-and-procedures-unmanned-aircraft#:~:text=This%20Regulation%20lays%20down%20detailed,organisations%20involved%20in%20those%20operations.)
- [Regulation (EU) 2019/945 on UAS and third-party operators of UAS](https://skybrary.aero/articles/regulation-2019945-uas-and-third-country-operators-uas)
- Germany - National Law on the adaptation of regulation (EU) 2019/947

### New UAM concepts
UAM is the protocol and technology to enable air traffic operations of cargo and passengers in an urban setting - More often than not, UAM involves green (electric) air vehicles like eVTOLs

**Urban** - Within cities **Air** - In the sky **Mobility** - A service offered
>[!Note]
>This definition should go to [[Urban Air Mobility]]

This is a *complex and risky endeavour* given its integration inside cities. There's a lot to consider with regards to passenger safety, smooth implementation and connection with existing transport facilities, and everything else. Rules, procedures, and technologies have to be considered rigorously

UAM often involves autonomous flights and BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line Of Sight) flights

### Geographical Zones
Part of **EU regulation 2019/947** (see paragraph **21h**), this is defined as
> A portion of airspace that facilitates, restricts, or excludes UAS operations

In the context of UAM, a **geographical zone** shouldn't be confused with literal geographical zones. Rather, they are "snippets" of airspace where unmanned aircraft may or may not operate. *A snippet would only be a geographical zone if some laws and regulations concerning UAS are in effect*
- What are the UAM geographical zones within other countries like India? 
- How are such zones decided? What are the factors that play a role?
- Is there a central platform available to readily identify UAM geographical zones around the world, or at least in a given country? Digital platforms are the answer such as Germany's **U-Space**

### U-Space
The **U-Space airspace** is a geographical zone dedicated to safely deploying and integrating UAS into the existing aviation network. To achieve this, there are certain *regulations* that have to be stipulated and brought into effect
- The aircraft must be *visible* to other aircraft to safely and smoothly coordinate air traffic 
- Every drone entering the U-Space is obliged to utilize a *U-Space service provider*. What do these people do?
	- They check if you have the right *permissions* to operate
	- They check if your *route* is okay
	- They check your drone itself for *capability*
	- They provide the following services
		- *Network Identification* service
		- *Flight Authorization* service
		- *Traffic Information* service
		- *Geo awareness* service
All data within the U-Space airspace is transferred to a certified *Common Information Service Provider (CISP)*. The CISP then transfers information to other service providers in the U-Space that then communicate and handle aircraft operating in the zone

To gain an understanding of how the U-Space airspace would be like practically, the **U-Space Reality Laboratory** was installed in Hamburg
The *EU Regulation 2021/664* provides the framework for developing the concept for establishing the U-Space airspace. U-Spaces *will not be deployed in rural areas* because it doesn't make sense and isn't required

### Obstacles for UAM
- *Risk assessment* according to SORA
- *High traffic density* in most urban settings (emergency missions etc.)
- Geographical zones (presence of other geo-zones inside, thus conflicting airspace authority)
- Ground infrastructure (smooth integration and minimal interference)
- Digital infrastructure (how to implement it at scale?)
- Public acceptance
