Four-dimensionalism is where instead of saying "X is not a part of Y", I would say, "X is not a part of Y at time t". I'm adding time as a descriptor of the object's existence but not in a temporal sense. This isn't me saying "X was a part of Y until this time" or "X is a part of Y now" -- The concept is not assigning the property of temporal progression to the entity. Rather, it's about treating time as how space is treated and in an unconditional manner (simpliciter).

When we say "I am sitting on a chair", that is the spatial interpretation of the event as we're all familiar with. Now, if I were a four-dimensionalist, I would say, "My temporal part is sitting on the chair's temporal part". If I stand up, I would say, "One temporal part of mine is sitting in one of the chair's temporal parts. My other temporal part is not sitting on the chair's other temporal part". It is the atemporal view of something that is temporal by nature.
