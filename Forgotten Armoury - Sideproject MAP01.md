A simple Doom 2 map I am currently working on. The focus is on building a relatively simple but fairly non-linear and deeply interconnected layout-wise, to enrich gameplay and replay value. This map is also an exercise for me to restrict my options to using just the stock Doom 2 textures. This is both a boon and a bane, to be honest. On one hand, I wouldn't spend lots of time deciding on which texture to use and wouldn't be spoilt for choice. Restrictions breed creative use of what we have at hand, and that philosophy seems to work well here too -- Good maps can be developed without any custom texture pack, and this map sets out to prove that. On the other hand, there are many textures and themes I desire that the stock textures simply lack. Packs like OTEX and cc4-tex have been amazing in their broad selection and theme coverage, and not using them can be a disappointment in that way.
