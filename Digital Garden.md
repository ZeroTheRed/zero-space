# Digital Garden

> A garden is something inbetween a personal blog and a wiki. It's a collection of evolving notes, essays, and ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory â€“ posts are linked through contextual associations

A digital garden is, just like the name says, a garden. It's your own personal garden where you can grow the plants of your choice. You tend to your plants with all the love and care you can pour into them, and you nurture them all the way through

In a similar vein, a digital garden is a nurtured collection of all you're doing. It can be several things collated into one centralized place
- Notes that you're working on and those that are developed
- Your thoughts and ideas that you have documented 
- A wiki of learned concepts, definitions, and topics that you came across
- A canvas of other websites, images, and other multimedia
- Literally anything else you can imagine!

Okay, but there's one important question that hasn't been answered yet. **Why do this?** Why is creating and maintaining a digital garden a constructive effort for me? 

Thoughts, concepts, and ideas. The abstract world of the inner mind is an ever-changing one. It's not concrete or solid like physical objects in the external world we interact with. It keeps morphing and developing.
**A digital garden helps me record my mind and tend to my thoughts, just like how you tend to your kitchen garden's plants**
Why can't I just do that mentally? Well, you see, the human brain is quite powerful but is it 100% reliable? No. I can spend hours or days reading books and several interesting articles but the next day, I'll forget them all. If you suddenly accost me and ask "Hey, what did you learn? Anything cool you discovered?", I'd be giving you a poker-face, worthy of the next viral meme. The brain is not quite reliable. The impermanence of ideas is a real obstacle I face on a daily basis. Maintaining a digital garden helps externalize my mind into something more reliable and permanent. It helps me save my rich inner world so that I can always come back to it regularly and continue tending to it

**My digital garden helps me remember my life's events and things I learned**
I identify as a lifelong learner. I value every single bit of knowledge that I pick up with the faith that it will be useful to me some day. I'm learning something every second. However, in this day and age, the flood of information can be overwhelming. Thousands of articles, books, videos, and people telling interesting stuff. How do I keep track of them? How can I possibly juggle with the massive shipment of information inside my brain? **How can I transform them into that which will be extremely useful and important for me in the future?**
Digital gardening is the answer. It is how I extract structure from chaos. It is my laboratory and "muck around and learn" chamber where I can play with the riff-raff and develop concrete snippets of wisdom that will serve a higher purpose for me in the short and long run
