**Quine's Paradox**
A self-reference paradox. "'yields falsehood if it precedes its quotation' yields falsehood if it precedes its quotation" is the paradox in question. The phrase essentially contradicts itself when logically followed. However, a close examination of "it", "its", and "its quotation" and assigning them values may eliminate the paradox.

**Grelling-Nelson Paradox**
An antinomy or another self-reference paradox of the English language. To explain this, consider the two words
* *Autological* - A word is autological if it describes itself. An example would be "unhyphenated"; the word does not have a hyphen, which is exactly what the word describes in the first place.
* *Heterological* - The opposite of "autological". A word such as "long" would be heterological because the word is not what it describes.
Now, the paradox arises when the following question is asked:-
* *Is the word "heterological" heterological?
	* *Yes* - Then "Heterological" is heterological -- "Heterological" does not describe itself -- So it would become "Autological" (Considering that the word now doesn't describe itself, it would naturally become the opposite here) -- "Heterological" is autological. There's a contradiction.
	* *No* - Then "Heterological" is not heterological -- "Heterological" is autological, so it should, by definition, describe itself, which eventually contradicts the very meaning of the word "Heterological".
A similar argument can be constructed for the word "Autological", and even attempting to modify the definitions to consider these two particular words would be in vain.

**Russell's Paradox**
Similar to the Grelling-Nelson Paradox but in set-theoretic notation. If we consider $R = \{x | x \not\in x \}$ then $R \in R \longleftrightarrow R \not\in R$ . If $R$ is a normal set (a set which is not a member of itself), then its definition entails that it is its own member. However, if $R$ is an abnormal set (a set which is its own member), then again by the definition, $R$ should not belong to itself.
