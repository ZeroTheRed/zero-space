Industry 4.0 is a neologism that describes **rapid technological development** of various industries. The key aspect of I4.0 is that industries employ the use of **automation and data-and-information processing technologies** to catapult growth and throughput
### What are the technologies employed in I4.0?
* [[Internet of Things (IoT)]] - A smart network of several small devices that are connected over a common IP address. The devices can communicate with each other using messaging protocols within their network 
* **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** - AI and Machine Learning algorithms can help develop intelligent machines that can predict and control the very processes that they are facilitating. This is also used to efficiently process large volumes of data and information pertaining to the factory and they can generate valuable and new insights
* [[Cloud Computing]] - Volumes of data can be uploaded and stored in the cloud network for easy logging and retrieval at any point of time. Moreover, compute resources can be distributed in the cloud as well, which allows weaker machines to make use of the available power to perform computations over the internet
* [[Edge Computing]] - The core concept of edge computing is that the data analysis and processing must be performed as close as possible to the source of the data i.e. "in the field". This greatly reduces latency and prevents the data from getting leaked or corrupted due to lengthy transmission paths
* **Cybersecurity** - Protection and security of data transmissions and devices connected to the network from corruption, malicious attacks, and theft
* Machine-to-Machine Communication (M2M)
* Data Analytics
* [[Predictive Maintenance]]
* [[Digital Twin]]
* [[Blockchain]]

### What's the benefit here?
The Fourth Industrial Revolution (or just Industry 4.0) will engender plenty of improvements and innovations geared towards smarter and more efficient manufacturing. Some of them are as follows
* **Easier error handling** - Connecting smartphones to the cloud that collects data from sensors in factories would help quality control engineers quickly monitor and detect errors before it's too late. Moreover, with the help of AI and Machine Learning, as well as big data processing, factory process data once considered cryptic and siloed in can now be easily interpreted. More real-time data that is readily retrievable from the cloud reduces confusion and error frequencies
* **Self-optimization and maintenance** - Predictive maintenance combined with edge computing, for example, can help reduce maintenance downtime
* **Increased access and transmissibility through the** [[Value Chain]]
* **Reduces dependency on crises**

WEF with McKinsey -> Global Lighthouse Network (GLN)
**Lighthouse** - Manufacturing site that has successfully implemented 4IR tech at scale (high operational impact)
* Lighthouses are 4IR benchmarks
* Develop and test-run 4IR tech here first before advancing them at scale (digital factory-like)

### Digital Transformation At Scale 
How do we enable responsible and efficient production and digital transformation at scale? How do we nurture [[Eco-efficiency|sustainability]], **productivity**, and active [[Workforce Engagement and Development|workforce management]]?
* **Agile approach** - Quick iterations, fast fails, continuous learning
* **Agile digital studios** - Spaces for proximity and collaboration
* **IIoT stack** - Integration of IIoT infra to form the tech backbone
* **IIoT academy** - Upskilling and learning programs for workers
* **Tech ecosystems** - Vendors, suppliers, customers, and related industries come together to produce extensive data sets and opportunities
* **Transformation offices** - Governance hub to assist lighthouse realization

Start small -> Scale up
Failing to scale -> **Pilot purgatory** (Companies never take off beyond the pilot phase, where they try new tech)
_2020 - 74% of surveyed companies ended up in PP_
