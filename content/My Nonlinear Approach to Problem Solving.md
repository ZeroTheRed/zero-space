In the context of innovation, I've been thinking deeply about how to optimally tackle a problem. So far, there are [[Problem Solving|two approaches]] to problem-solving in innovation that I've learnt -- the *problem-centric* and *technology-centric* approaches

### The idea
I plan to begin with collecting use cases and case studies of the technology that I'm focusing on. By immediately jumping to this stage, I ensure that I can perform an unconstrained search and retrieve plenty of good case studies that amply cover and showcase what the technology under focus can do. 

When I complete that phase, I then begin mind-mapping out what capabilities have been used in each case study. This part borrows from the [[Problem-centric Approach]]. The key difference is that here, I respect and exploit the fact that multiple use cases can share the same capabilities of the technology, so I make connections accordingly. This results in a visually chaotic network of concepts akin to a dense neural network. Ugly and seemingly impractical, isn't it?

The interesting part begins here. The chaos that we have generated is where we'll pull order from. Now, from the map of use cases and technological capabilities that we have produced, we are free to select random pathways, which serve as foundation ideas that can be further examined and built upon. It is at this stage that the [[Technology-centric Approach]] is followed. What's the end result? We will generate innovative use cases of the technology from the randomised paths that we selected from the problem-solving approach

So, in summary, the structure is:

**Use cases** ---> *Technology* ---> **New use cases**
