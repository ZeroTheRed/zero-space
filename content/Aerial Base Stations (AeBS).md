>[!Definition]
>**AeBS** or **UAV-mounted Base Station (UBS)** is a **flying antenna** system that functions as a **hub** b/w the **backhaul network** and **access network**


> [!info]
> **Backhaul Network** - The infrastructure that connects a *local network* or a *subnetwork* to the *core or backbone network*
> 
> **Access Network** - The network that connects *end users* to their *immediate service provider* 

### Advantages
1. **Ad hoc** - AeBS can be readily deployed anytime and anywhere *on demand*. If more AeBS are present, then a **FANET** (**F**ly **A**d-hoc **NET**work) is formed
2. **Do Not Disturb** - Since UAVs can attain *high altitudes* and are *freely positionable in 3D space*, they are more immune to *interference* and have a better *Line of Sight (LoS)* . This is synergistic with *5G networks using millimeter wave technology that requires good LoS*
3. **Internet from the Heavens** - Higher altitudes and lesser interference means *greater internet connectivity* across *broader ground ranges*

### Limitations
1. **Energy Starved** - There's not enough energy that can be easily provided to AeBS, thus resulting in a trade-off b/w quality and power 
2. **No Privacy** - AeBS may breach data security and privacy 

### Real-life AeBS Examples
1. Amazon Air
2. [[Alphabet Wing]]
3. [[AT&T - Flying COWs]]
