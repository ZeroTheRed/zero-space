>Digital Thread/Digital Chain is the use of digital tools and infrastructure to collect data and information from anywhere in the product lifecycle, its transport, or its supply chain and feeding it forward to the other areas in the grand product ecosystem to improve its manufacturing, efficiency, and performance

**Digital Thread** is related to [[Digital Twin]] but the key difference is that the former is the **process** while the latter is the **technology**

A Digital Thread enables a Digital Twin by making sure that the incoming data stream is uniform and *easily accessible* through three main *data chains* <-- [[Digital Thread.canvas|Digital Thread]] (Mind Map)
1. **Product Innovation Chain** 
2. **Enterprise Value Chain** 
3. **Field and Service Chain**
