# Linear Thinking


>[!Definition]
>Systematic and sequential thinking

**Linear thinking** is generally a highly *practical* form of thinking that involves parsing information in a *procedural manner*.  Linear thinkers prefer taking things *sequentially* from A to B, following concepts *step by step*. The opposite of this form of thinking is [[Nonlinear Thinking]]

Think of linear thinking as using a powerful but highly focused laser to burn a deep but narrow hole. Linear thinkers rely on rules (guidelines to constrain and focus their work) and logic to guide themselves to the solution

> If A = B and B = C, then A = C

This is a powerful tool in the arsenal for specific problems. *Whenever a problem has a singular solution that can be approached procedurally* - something that's simple enough, linear thinking is fast and no-frills. Thinkers using this tool are more efficiency at their jobs because they are laser-focused. They have one goal and they don't beat around the bush to reach it

### The pitfalls of linear thinking
> The human brain likes simple straight lines

This quote from a [HBR article](https://hbr.org/2017/05/linear-thinking-in-a-nonlinear-world) I recently read highlights a key aspect of linear thinking. You see, we humans are predisposed to simple and straightforward patterns. This might be a good thing in many places - We often want to *linearize* non-linear systems of equations to solve mathematical problems in control theory, for instance. However, is it always a good way to think? **No**
We live in a heavily *non-linear* world. Relationships are usually quite non-linear, which the law of [diminishing returns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns) being a well-known example

Linear thinkers suffer from:
- Inability to explore and consider **multiple perspectives and solutions**
- **Stubbornness** and closed-minded approach to solutions. This is the [[Einstellung Effect]] at play! With more age and experience, our linear thinking becomes more and more apparent and then it overshoots - we're now applying our own "tried and tested for decades" approach to every problem out there! Most of them cannot be solved by a singular approach anymore. Open-mindedness to several possibilities is the key
