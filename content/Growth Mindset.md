Mindset is a lens we apply to selectively filter and organize everything we perceive

* What have I been told I am good at?
* What have I been told I am poor at?
* What am I good at and why? 
	* Did I put in effort at them? Or was it natural?
* What am I bat at and why?
	* Despite your best efforts or did you not do much anyways?
* How is your label/identity attached to all this?
* What is your typical narrative when you're doing something you're good at and bad at?
