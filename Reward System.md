The **prefrontal cortex** (carrot) and the **amygdala** (stick) form the **reward system** of the brain

#### Amygdala - The stick
The **amygdala** is the part of the brain that is responsible for your **fear, stress, and anxiety** - It processes **intense emotional stimuli** 

>[!info]
>Memories associated with **intense emotions** are **more quickly** encoded into **long-term memories**
>
>This is because neural pathways that are recognised as **harmful** are remembered **long-term** -- your brain 

#### Prefrontal Cortex - The Carrot
The **prefrontal cortex** and the **dopamine pathways** are responsible for **high-level goals** and **delayed gratification**

>[!info]
>**Dopamine** is the **neurotransmitter** responsible for **sending reward messages.** It's one of the 4 **happy hormones** 

Everytime you do something that **aligns with your long-term goals**, the prefrontal cortex send **dopamine** to the [[hippocampus]], **signaling to it that it needs to be encoded into long-term memory**
