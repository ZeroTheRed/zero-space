Good learning involves **3 components**
1. **Motivation**
2. **Knowledge Retention**
3. **Future Transfer of Knowledge**

#### Ebbinghaus' Forgetting Curve
We tend to **forget 90% of the material learned quickly** 
The **first one or two days** are the most **crucial** to learning and memory retention

Keep **revising, repeating, and revisiting** what you have been learning

[[Hippocampus|Spaced Repetition]] is the key here - **reviewing material** over a **longer period** of time, **spreading out learning sessions**

**Expanding Retrieval** - When you have learned something, **revisit it after an hour**, then **revisit after two hours** and like that, keep extending the **interval between revision**

>[!info]
>The way **expanding retrieval** works is that when we are reviewing what we have forgotten, it takes **more work** and it allows us to **go back through the consolidation process**
