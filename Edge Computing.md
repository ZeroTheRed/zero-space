Edge Computing is where data is obtained and processed **close to the source** (in-field)
#### <font style="color:lightgreen">Advantages</font>
* Low latency 
* Lesser data corruption
* Cheaper (transmission distance reduced)
* Easy to debug and rectify issues
* Optimize network usage

Deep reinforcement Q-learning model based on autonomic computation offloading for mobile edge/fog devices that improves the overall performance in the computations offloading.
