In Zanzibar, Tanzania, **Anti-Malaria Drones** deployed UAVs to spray **Aquatain AMF**, a natural mosquito larvae repellent agent on rice paddy farms

The drones used were **DJI Agras MG-1S**, modified by DJI to handle heavier and more viscous payloads. The flight controller software was rewritten and the hardware was modified to account for the new agent

After a month, a **90% reduction** in mosquito larvae was reported

Drones can spray fields **10% to 50% faster** than traditional methods while being **cheaper** than manual aircraft

Training farmers to use and operate the drones was also easy, since it took **2 hours or less**
