## Interleaving
The process of alternating between learning multiple different (and somewhat disjoint) topics. For example, if you are studying physics, you would interleave your learning of physics with learning how to write software code. It would look like
**Physics** -- *Code* -- **Physics** -- *Code* -- **Physics** -- *Code* etc.
Interleaving is a powerful method to boost learning and intelligence because 
- It boosts cognitive adaptability - You're hopping between two topics, which may not necessarily be closely connected. By doing so, you are strengthening your brain's ability to actively recall information and seamlessly transition between different topics and experiences
- It improves associativity - Interleaving allows you to cross multiple subjects together by the sheer act of alternating between them. Leaving one task and focusing on another task will enable intersecting the two tasks and forming connections between them

## Incubation
Incubation is the psychological phenomenon of leaving a problem for a short while by engaging in something else (usually a non-stimulating or less stimulating activity) and returning back to the problem
Incubation is effective because it allows the default mode network of the brain to take over the task of processing a problem when we're off on a short break or when relaxing. If you're familiar with the concept of shower thoughts (getting epiphanies or sudden solutions to problems while in the shower), that is incubation at play. 
Taking a walk, having a shower, taking a nap, meditation, and yoga are some of the ways one can detach themselves temporarily from the problem and by the time they're back, they would have automatically gained valuable insights
