>JUICE (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is ESA's satellite probe that was deployed to Jupiter to study Jupiter and its three large ocean-bearing moons - Ganymede, Europa, and Callisto[^1]

# Objectives
JUICE's objectives are to
- Analyse and study Jupiter and its environment
- Study the three ocean-bearing moons of Jupiter, and how they, along with Jupiter itself, form a planetary system that serves as the archetype of all other gas giants. Ganymede is JUICE's primary focus for its uniqueness and complex subsurface
- Observe the potential of Jupiter's system as a habitat
Jupiter and its moons hold a plethora of secrets function as the key to understanding the habitability of the moons. JUICE also aim to study the dynamics of the system, how dust rings are formed, interactions and strengths of magnetic fields, the chemical composition of the atmosphere, and the hot temperatures that are common there. My understanding of this is that JUICE seeks to comprehensively map Jupiter and its moons to develop a solid foundation and understanding of it[^2]
