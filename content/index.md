title: The Zero Space

## Hello there! 



Ah, so you have decided to venture right into my digital garden, haven't you? Your curiosity is quite commendable

Welcome to the Zero Space. Who am I, you ask? Oh yeah, where are my manners. I am Tushar, an aspiring engineer by day, and an absurd walnut by night. Does that tickle your fancy? Well then

---> [[About me|here's more about me]] <---

This is what I'd like to call my own [[Digital Garden|digital garden]]. There are a plethora of other names for such knowledge bases too. You can call this a second brain (or an exo-brain, if you fancy hot and sizzling technobabble), a commonplace book, a cross-breed of the wiki and blog systems, or an "everything journal"

In short, this is where I do the following:
- I **record and journal about everything I am learning**. The topics and fields I check out are in different fields such as space, economics, and the human brain. You'll find conceptual definitions, short notes about various topics, some of the courses I studied, and more. Think of this as my personal Wikipedia
- I **transfer all of my thoughts into this garden for digital permanence**. My reflections and musings on this world will all be here for you to laugh at to your heart's content
- I **quantify my life**. I like to model everything I'm doing into wacky numbers and graphs. If you want to know why I waste my time doing that, my goals are beyond your understanding, so don't think too hard
- I **journal about my days**. Journaling is an exercise for mindfulness. This is my gateway drug to decluttering my noisy and anxious mind
- I **like to store and organize anything I've come across**. Great books, YouTube videos, blogs, websites, places, and all that? Oh yes, they're all archived here for posterity. I love to come back to these
