>**Analytical thinking** is the type of thinking that involves solving problems and breaking them down into smaller components and working through them using *deductive reasoning* and no prior knowledge about the subject

[[Problem Solving]] is the core backbone. 

**Data Collection** is the first step. You collect and organize all the data and information crucial to the issue. Visualization and rearrangement of the data may be necessary

**Pattern recognition** is a frequent theme in analytical reasoning. The way such thinkers proceed is to identify common trends and patterns across the problem domain they are focusing on, after breaking down the problem into smaller parts that are easier to process

**Assimilation** is important as well. Logically breaking the problem down into manageable snippets that can be individually tackled is vital to analytical problem solving
